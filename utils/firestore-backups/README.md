# Tutorbook Firestore Backups

Included in this directory are locally stored (not backed up to GitHub for
obvious privacy reasons) Firestore backup JSON files created with [this command
line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-firestore-import-export).

Filenames indicate the start time of the backup and are as follows:
```
MM-DD-YYYY-HR:MIN-AM/PM.json
```
