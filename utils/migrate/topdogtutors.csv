I view tutoring as a contract/relationship between two people, i.e. the more effort you put into it, the more you get out of it.  There is are no silver bullets.  Yes, occasionally there are great &quot;insights&quot; to be had, but one must spend time and effort to wire one's own head until the &quot;aha&quot; moments comes from within.  My job is to identify your barriers and help you disentangle knots in your head that might be holding you back.","I enjoy all sorts of sports, but nowadays spend time skate boarding because I enjoy watching the cool tricks and hope to one day do the simplest of them.",download.png

In high school, I worked as a math tutor for 3 different students throughout the course of my junior and senior year. I tutored a variety of levels including algebra 2, pre calculus, and AP calculus. I also served as a general tutor for an after school tutoring program through the National Honor Society. In these prior positions, I worked one-on-one with students and also in small peer groups in a range of different subject materials. 

My motivation in applying to be a tutor is two fold. First, like many at Berkeley, I am familiar with the struggle and frustration that comes with taking rigorous coursework. As a STEM major who has always had a love for the math/sciences, I want to be able to minimize this frustration for other students to the best of my ability. In my past tutoring experiences, I have always found it very fulfilling and rewarding when I am able to explain a concept to someone and help them really understand a problem that they were struggling with. Secondly, I have found that there is no better way to test your understanding of something than if you have to teach it to someone else. Becoming a tutor would be a very valuable experience for me because it will solidify my understanding of key concepts and be a built in review of topics that are critical to my major.
